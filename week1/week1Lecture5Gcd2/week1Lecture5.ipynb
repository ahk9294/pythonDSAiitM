    "This lecture is taken forward from the point where we left in *Lecture 3*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In *Lecture 3*, we were trying to calculate the gcd of two numbers. We developed two versions of the 'gcd functions' - **gcd1** and **gcd2** and noticed that there was no difference in their efficiency. As in both functions the ***time taken*** or the ***number of steps involved*** in calculation of gcd were ***proportional to the 'size' of the smaller number***. (*look their codes in lecture 3*)\n",
    "\n",
    "In real world programming we don't want that our algorithm grows *much* as the size of input becomes \"larger\". As we frequently encounter with large numbers in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we keep on searching for new algorithms such that even if the algorithm grows with the 'size of input', this growth is not much faster. As both *time* and *computing resource* are most valuable and indemand things in the world of programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes while working in the spirit of searching the *most efficient* algorithm for solving a problem, we develop such algorithms that their actual solution (or their code) becomes  ***non-obvious*** or ***Non- trivial***. (....which means that **by just \"looking at the 'actual solution' or code\" we cannot quickly figure out what that code is doing.**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us illustrate this with the help of **gcd** example.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this discussion we will see how we arrives at a **Non-Trivial solution** of gcd, which is more 'efficient' than its **Trvial solutions** -->**gdc1** and **gcd2**.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why we call 'gcd1' and 'gcd2' a 'Trivial solution'?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is because their codes depends on the 'straight-forward' definition of the gcd. i,e Greatest Common Factor. This can be easily figured out by looking at the codes of **gcd1** and **gcd2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we noticed that these **Trivial solution** are not efficient as time taken by them 'quickly grows' with the 'size' of input...so we need more efficient ways of this.\n",
