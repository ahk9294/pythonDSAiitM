Week1 Lecture 1: Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab.
<hr>

In this course we will study Data Structure and Algorithms in the Python programming language. 

The platform we use to both document and practice the python code will be *Jupyter Notebooks*.


## What are Jupyter Notebooks?

Jupyter notebook is an interesting way to create *documents which involves code*.

It provides a platform where we can write explainatory *text* as well as *code* both inside one document. 

The best thing is we can *compile* well as *preserve the output*  of the code within the notebook itself.

This makes the study of code more involving.

The name Jupyter is derived from **Ju**lia **pyt**hon and **R**.

These are the programming languages that were initially supported by Jupyter Notebooks, but these days it supports various other popular programing languages.

In this course we will use Jupyter notebooks with the Python kernel.


## Using Jupyter Notebooks in Google Colab environment.

Google colab is build upon the Jupyter Notebooks standards, produces the same *.ipynb* files, which the original Jupyter Notebook produces.

One can say that *Google colab* is an *instance of Jupyter Notebook* , specially tailored by Google with some extra features.

## Structure of a Jupyter notebook.

Every Jupyter notebook file has  *'.ipynb'* extension.

This file itself is a Jupyter Notebook!

The complete notebook is made of linearly arranged individual *cells* , stacked one over other from top to bottom.

Every cell can either contain some execuatble code or a markdown sytax. This means that each cell is of a particular  *type*.- either *code* or *markdown* type.

## Summary

- Jupyter notebook is a convinent interface to develop Python code.

- Incementally update and run.

- Preserve outputs when exporting.

- Useful for collaboration, sharing.

- Google collab is free to use version of Jupyter notebook configured for Machine Learning.
