## Test Different Versions of the same code inside Jupyter Notebook. 

Jupyter notebooks are the best places to test code. 

Specially in situations when we are experimenting with different versions of the same code.

Suppose we are in the situation when we have two different algorithms for doing the same thing. Now we want to test how these algorithm behaves for different range of inputs supplied to them from some frontend code.

It turns out Jupyter notebooks are the best places for doing such experiments. 

Because we can write each algorithm in a separate cell and then within the same notebook....in a separate cell....we can also write the frontend code to take the inputs. (means we dont have to switch beetween different windows to test our code).

Now once the algorithm cells and the frontend cells are ready we can selectively run the cell belonging to perticular algrithm and test it for the currently supplied input from the frontend cell.

Prof. Madhvan demonstrated it using different algorithms for *testing primes*. The python notebook used by him is present in the week1Lec2 directory.
