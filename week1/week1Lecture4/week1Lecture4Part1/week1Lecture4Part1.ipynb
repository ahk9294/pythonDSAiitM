    "\n",
    "Any number having **only and only** two factors, **not less than 2...not greater than 2**, are prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- These two factors are fixed :  the number 1 and the number itself.\n",
    "- Notice that 1 is not a prime as it have only **one factor** i.e the 1 itself.\n",
    "- The smallest prime is 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this *lecture 4* we are going to play with *prime numbers*. The lecture will be somewhat long so we have divided it into **two parts** :\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In Part-1** we will try to design some strategies in python to check the ***Primality*** of the given number. We will write several pieces of codes (functions) with different strategie to check wether a supplied number is prime or not. Along with this we will also discuss which among these function is the *most efficient* in terms of *time* and *computing resources they use*... \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the most efficient function to check for *primality* we will proceed to **Part-2** of this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In Part-2** We will take the *most efficient* primality checking function developed in *Part-1* and use it in  solving more *complex* problems like :\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ..identifying the number of primes in a given range. Means adderssing questions like *There are how many primes between 1 and 100?* \n",
    "    - .. keeping track of the differences between two consecutive primes in some range.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will identify and 'embrace' the fact that these kind complex operations becomes lot easier once we first define a basic function to check wether a given number is prime or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "While doing the above journey we will be recaping some syntax and commonly used structures in python to *store* the data ( *Data Structures*  ).\n",
    "\n",
    "Few very popular *Data Structures* are like :\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **variable**, **list** and **Dictionary** .\n",
    "\n",
    "- there are few more.... like **Tuples** and **set** which we often use when some specific situation arise.\n",

    "- Once we have a list of factors then we can make another function **prime1** which takes the list returned by the **factors** function and then checks --> wether this list contains **two and only two factors** i.r [1, the input number]\n",
    "\n",
    "    - notice here that **prime1** depends on another function **factors**. Thus its efficiency is not 'independent', infact it depends upon the efficiency of **factors**.\n",
