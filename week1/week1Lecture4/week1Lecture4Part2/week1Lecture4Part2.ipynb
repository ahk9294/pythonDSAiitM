This makes possible to 'compare' these datatypes to test for equality. We will discuss the examples of the datatypes later but let us first talk about--> <br><br>**What do we mean by the *'hash values'* of a data type? how they look like ? and how they are calculated ?**<br><br> A *Hash function* is a mathematical function that takes an *input(or \"message\")* and return a ***fixed size string* of *bytes*** , which is typically a ***hash value*** of the input. We can even 'see' this hash value using ***hash()*** function in python.<br><br>**Hashable objects** in Python are those whoes *hash values never changes* during their lifetime and can be compared for equality.<br><br> Examples of *hashable objects*- <br><br> *strings*,*integers*,*floats*,*boolean*,*tuples ( only if their elements are hashable)* and *custom objects* with proper *_ _ hash _ _* implementation<br><br>Examples of *Non-hashable object* :<br><br>*Lists*,*tuples(with non hashable elements)*,*dictionaries*, *sets*, *custome objects* without proper *_ _ hash_ _* implementation<br><br>Whenever in doubt we can use this *hash()* functionto check if an object is hashable. If it's hashable it will return a value. otherwise it will raise a 'TypeError'.<br><br> \n",
