Let us start the study of *Data structures and Algorithms* by recaping the *syntax* and *functionalities* of python.

We will do this with the help of some running examples.

## Computing gcd of two numbers.
Consider the problem of computing the **gcd** of two numbers.

###  What is 'gcd'?

**gcd** or *greatest common factor/divisor* also sometimes called the **hcf**.


The most illustrative way of calculating gcd of two numbers is:
- *listing* all common factors of both numbers separately.....
- and then selecting the largest one among both of them.

Lets code this in python
