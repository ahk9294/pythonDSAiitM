    "Given a custom implementation of list named MyList. On MyList objects you can perform read operations similar to the in-build lists in Python, example use A[i] to read element at index i  in MyList object A. The only possible operation that you can use to edit data  in MyList objects is by calling the swap method. For instance, A.swap(indexA, B , indexB) will swap values at A[indexA] and B[indexB] and A.swap(index1, A , index2) will swap values at A[index1] and A[index2], where indexA , indexB , index1 , index2 are all integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the Python function mergeInPlace(A, B) that accepts two MyLists  A and B containing integers that are sorted in ascending order and merges them inplace(without using any other list) such that after merging,  A and B are still sorted in ascending order with the smallest element of both MyLists as  the first element of  A .\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:- Your function should not return any list and should only merge the given sorted lists inplace.**\n",

    "Initially i didnt understand the problem ..Chatgpt (windows copilot)explained it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure, I will try to explain the problem in simple words. ðŸ˜Š\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is about how to merge two lists of numbers that are already sorted from smallest to largest. For example, if you have two lists like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "A = [2, 4, 6, 9, 13, 15]\n",
    "B = [1, 3, 5, 10]\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to merge them so that they become like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "B = [9, 10, 13, 15]\n",
    "\n",
    "The catch is that you cannot create a new list or copy any values from one list to another. You can only swap values between the two lists using a special method called swap. For example, if you want to swap the first value of A with the first value of B, you can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "A.swap(0, B, 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "This will change the lists to:\n",
    "\n",
    "A = [1, 4, 6, 9, 13, 15]\n",
    "B = [2, 3, 5, 10]\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is to write a function that can merge any two sorted lists in this way, using only the swap method and without creating any new lists or copying any values.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this explanation helps you understand the problem better. ðŸ˜Š\n",
