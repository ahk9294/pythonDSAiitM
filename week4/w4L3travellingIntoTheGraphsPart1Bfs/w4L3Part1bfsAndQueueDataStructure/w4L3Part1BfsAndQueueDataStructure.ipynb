    "Notice that the only difference which occurs into the adjecency List is that here we dont need an extra function **neighbours** to look for the neigbours of each vertex. Infact the list of neighbours are itself maintained in the Adjecency list representation. This advantage saves computations resource for us and code works more efficiently. We will soon see this advantage during analysis of complexities of BFS with adjecency matrix and Adjecency list.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - this was done by the neighbour function which look through all the columns of the specific row to which vertex belongs in Adjecency Matrix to extract the List of neighbours.Notice even if only one neighbour is present for a vertex the neighbour function have to take $n$ steps and look through all the columns to prepare the list of neigbours for that vertex.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - Notice that in **Adjecency List** representation we dont have any **neighbour** function to extract the list of neighbours, infact the neighbour list of each vertex is already present in adjecency list. For some vertex there are few neighbours (degree of a vertex), and for some others there could be more neighbours thus during execution we specifically dont know exactly how much time it takes to process a single vertex --> but for all vertex we know for sure that the total time taken will be sum of their individual degree (i.e 2 times the number of edges present in the Graph).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Why '2 times' the number of edges?\n",

    "\n",
    "Thus the complexity $O(m+n)$ is much better than complexity $n^2$. Thus **Adjecency List** representation is better than  **Adjecency Matrix** in case of BFS.\n",
