    "A $Graph(V,E)$ is something which we cannot 'see' from eyes,(untill we draw it pictoraially) and its a tedious time-consuming task to draw the pictures of every graph and inspect it manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if someone asks, can we reach from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ in this network/graph? We cannot give a straight away answer untill we 'inspect' the graph by travelling through it. For travelling we may use either of BFS or DFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may happen that in the given graph all the vertices are not be connected, which means that, there may be some 'regions' in the graph which are completely disconnected or broken from the other regions. These disconnected/broken regions are called '**Components**' and  the $Graphs(V,E)$ which contains disconnected regions are called - **Disconnected or Broken Graphs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets discuss concept of **connectivity**, in more details for both types of graphs - *Directed* and *Undirected*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets first discuss for undirected graphs, as they are easy to understand. \n",

    "**Connectivity in undirected graphs**\n",

    "\n",
    "    - It is an property of an undirected graph, that , if we found a path from $u$ to $v$ , it is *guarenteed* that there will be the reverse path from $v$ to $u$, it is because the edges have no directions. \n",
    " \n",
    "- But if in an undirected $Graph(V,E)$ , there is a vertex or a *group of vertices* which is completely separate from other vertices, then the graph becomes **Disconnected** or **Broken** and  **concept of components** becomes visible into the picture of the $Graph(V,E)$.\n",

    "**The concept of Components :**\n",
    "\n",
    "A $Graph(V,E)$ is thought to be made up of one or several *components*. \n",
    "\n",
    "If all the vertices of a graph are *connected* through some edges (directed or undirected) then the whole Graph  have *only one component*.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we if there is some vertex (or group of vertices which may be interconnected among themselves) that is completely separete from other vertices (with no edges) then the $Graph(V,E)$ contains *more than one components*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus a single $Graph(V,E)$ (Directed or Undirected) can be thought of to be made up of **components** either one or several.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should be able to detect the components in the given $Graph(V,E)$, programatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let now discuss the connectivity in Directed graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connectivity in Directed graphs**\n",
    "\n",
    "If a $Graph(V,E)$ contains edges with 'directions' (Directed graphs), then the concept of 'connectivity' becomes little bit complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this simple example graph of *two vertices* and a *single directed edge* :  **$u$ <-- $v$** ,here,\n",
    "- We can move from $v$ to $u$.\n",
    "- But we cannot go from $u$ to $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we call this graph *connected*? Remember in an connected graph, if there is a path between $u$ --> $v$ then there ***must*** be a *reverse* path between $v$ --> $u$ also, for 'every pair' of $u$ and $v$ in the $Graph(V,E)$. Thus *its not good to call the example graph - **connected*** . We can call it a *one-way connected* graph. But formally, it is called a **weakly connected graph**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So , from the point of view of connectivity , a Directed Graph can be categorized as :\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strongly Connected Graph**. and \n",
    "- **Weakly connected Graph**.\n",
    "- **Broken Graph** or **Disconnected Graph**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Directed graph is called **Strongly connected** if for 'every pair' of vertex $(u,v)$ in the $Graph(V,E)$, there is a path from $u$ to $v$ and also a *reverse path* from $v$ to $u$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the $Graph(V,E)$ is not **Strongly connected**, there may be two possibilites further :\n",
    "\n",
    "- Either the Graph is **broken** or **disconnected** to have several components... and if its not *broken*,\n",
    "- then the Graph is something called **Weekly connected**..\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Broken graphs** are the ones in which, we will find some pair of vertices with no paths between $u$ and $v$ and also vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - and **Weakly connected Graphs** are the ones , which are **not broken**, and inside them we will find some pair $(u,v)$ such that there is a path between $u$ to $v$ but not necessarily vice-versa ( as in our example Graph  $u$ <-- $v$ which contains *only* two vertices).\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to detect that the given graph is 'broken' or 'weakly connected' ? :**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a *Directed* $Graph(V,E)$. Now, If after replacing all the directed edges of this graph by undirected edges (i.e after *removing the directions* of the edges) , the graph becomes **completely connected**... then we call the Graph **\"Weakly\" connected**. This means that the graph $G(V,E)$ is found to be ***connected if we ignore the directions of edges***. This finding ensures that the whole graph is a *single large component* and is not **Broken**. And when we restore back the 'directions' of edges, the graph $G(V,E)$ again become **disconnected** ---> this is the case of **Weak connectivity**--(**connected without directions of edges**).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if after removing the directions from the edges in the given $Graph(V,E)$, if it is still found to be disconnected. Then it means that the graph is '**broken**' --> which further implies that it have *more than one component*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we have discussed now the concepts of **Connected** and **Broken graphs** and also for the 'Directed' Graphs, we know what are **Strongly connected** and **Weakly connected** graphs. We also discussed the concept of **Components**.\n",
