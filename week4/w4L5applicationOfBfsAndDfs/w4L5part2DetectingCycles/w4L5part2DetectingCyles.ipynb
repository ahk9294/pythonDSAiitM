    "\n",
    "Detecting Cycles is a complex task programmatically. And in a Directed graph it becomes more complex. \n",

    "Lets first talk generally about how could we go about detecting cycles in an graphs?\n",
    "\n",
    "- First lets talk about Detecting Cycles in **Undirected graphs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    One thing is clear , to detect cycles we need to travel through the $Graph(V,E)$, and for that we do either BFS and DFS. If we want to get a method for detecting cycles , we need to see how BFS and DFS explore the graph - i.e in other words what are their *footprints* in the graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    On carefull examination It turn out that both BFS and DFS when travels through the graph generates a **tree** *like structure*. They are respectively known as **BFS Tree** and **DFS Tree** of the $Graph(V,E)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "    *Trees* in this picture are highlighted in red colored vertices. They were generated as we started the BFS from vertex $0$ in the Graphs. The Bottom right graph have ***two broken components*** so *two BFS trees* were generated for a single Graph - They are collecteively called a ***Forest***.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Notice the fact we want to point out in this picture : \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \"*Any **Non Tree Edge** in these BFS trees(of UnDirected Graphs) forms a **cycle**.*\"\n",

    "    Lets now see a **DFS TREE**.\n",

    "    - A **DFS tree** of the same *Un Directed graph* can  be seen in the following picture.\n",

    "    ![DFS tree](./w4L5part2images/DFS_tree.jpg)\n",

    "    \n",
    "    These trees were generated as we started the DFS from vertex $0$ in the Graph. As the graph has two broken components so two DFS trees ( *or a Forest*) are generated.\n",

    "\n",
    "    \"*Any **Non Tree Edge**(marked in red) in these DFS trees(of UnDirected Graphs) forms a **cycle**.*\"\n",

    "\n",
    "    1. Do the the BFS or DFS on the Graph and generate the respective trees.\n",
    "    2. Search for any **NON Tree Edge** , if we found any Non-tree Edge than it will form a Cycle.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Here is another another thing to Notice over here - The **DFS tree** for the Directed graph is ***lot more detailed*** than the **BFS tree**. Infact *it is revealing more information about the structure of the Directed Graph*.\n",
