    "This function uses a recursive approach to find the longest path in a directed acyclic graph, where the graph represents the cities and the routes between them. The function assumes that the graph is given as an adjacency list, where each key is a city and each value is a list of cities that can be reached from it in the south direction. The function also assumes that the graph does not contain any cycles, which means that there is no way to travel back to the north.\n",

    "The function works by looping through the nodes in the graph and finding the longest path from each node, using a helper function longestPath(). The helper function takes four parameters: the graph, the start node, the visited set, and the current path. The helper function marks the start node as visited and adds it to the path, then loops through the adjacent nodes of the start node and recursively finds the longest path from each of them. The helper function returns the maximum length and the best path from the start node, and updates the global maximum length and the best path accordingly. The helper function also removes the start node from the path and the visited set before returning, to allow exploring other paths from different nodes.\n",
